# Push to Multiple GitHub Accounts

## Current Remotes:
- `origin`: https://github.com/Harshitvishnoiatbrightrays/whatsapp-automation.git
- `other`: https://github.com/harshitvishnoi08/whatsapp-automation.git

## To push to both accounts:

```bash
# Push to the first account (brightrays)
git push origin main

# Push to the second account (harshitvishnoi08)
git push other main
```

## Or push to both at once:

```bash
git push origin main && git push other main
```

## Note:
Make sure the repository exists on both GitHub accounts before pushing.
